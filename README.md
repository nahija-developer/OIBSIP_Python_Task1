 Project Title: BMI Calculator 
📖 Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a simple Python-based application to perform a specific task (like BMI calculation, password generator, calculator, etc.). This task helps to strengthen the core understanding of Python programming, logic building, and basic UI/CLI interaction.

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Core concepts)

Tkinter (if GUI is used)

VS Code / PyCharm (IDE)

Matplotlib / CSV (if data storage or plotting is involved)

🚀 Steps Performed
Defined the problem and planned the solution structure.

Used core Python concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, loops, etc.

(Optional) Built a GUI using Tkinter for a better user interface.

Stored user data or displayed results interactively.

(Optional) Added graph/chart to visualize results using matplotlib.

Tested the code for different inputs to ensure accuracy.

✅ Outcome
The project successfully demonstrates the implementation of basic to medium-level Python logic to solve real-world problems. This task helped in improving my confidence in Python and GUI/data handling.
